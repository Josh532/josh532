## Hi there 👋

I'm Josh, a full stack developer from New Zealand!

I am currently working on an ncea tracker app helping students across NZ track their credit goals.

I am currently learning python, as I will be developing an ai chat bot for my ncea tracker.

You can reach me via the contact section in my website www.joshmck.site
